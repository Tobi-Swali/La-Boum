## <#>-------------<=======[ Disclaimer ]=======>-------------<#>

This bot is NOT a simple plug-and-play installation.  
There is no invite-link for just joining on a discord server.  
You need to set it up yourself!  

To create a bot you first have to create an application in the 'Discord Developer Portal' and then add a bot to your application.
Next you need to add the bot to your server. Simply replace the '##################' with your application ID.
(Bot invite link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=##################&scope=bot)  
Now you need a place to host the bot. If you need it running 24/7 you should consider hosting it on a onw or rented server. For short time use you can also run it in an IDE or in a terminal.  
Optional: You can give your bot a role for better rights management.  

## <#>-------------<=======[ Commands ]=======>-------------<#> 
    All listed bot commands are in need of a "/" (slash) as first character of the command.  
    (Note: You are able to change the "/" in the language xml files)  
    
  
### Help:

| Command | Description |
| --- | ---|
/help      | displays the necessary commands for any player
/helpmaster| displays the necessary commands for the gamemaster (including all from player)

  
### Language:

| Command | Description |
| --- | ---|
/lang(uage)| displays the currently chosen language and other available languages   
/lang(uage) xx| changes the language to xx   

  
### Dice:  
  
To roll dice you have to follow the following input-pattern:
| Command | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
/XdY{#Z}| / is needed to be recogniced as a command
/<b>4</b>d2+6| X is the amount of dice
/4d<b>2</b>+6| Y is the kind of dice
/4d2<b>+</b>6| # is the operand (+, -, *, /)
/4d2+<b>6</b>| Z is the value
/4d2<b>+6</b>| {} from pattern means it is optional input
/4d2| here is the example without the optional input operation

The output for the last example would get an output like this:   
Rolled: 4x d2 +6: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5 + 6 = 11 @name  
Rolled: 4x d2: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5 @name

  
### Simplyfied throws:

| Command (short) | Command (actual) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
/1 or /2 or /3 | rolls 1, 2 or 3 d20's | simplyfied d20's
/4 or higher   | rolls 1d4 or higher   | simplyfied single dice throw
/d2 or higher  | rolls 1d2 or higher   | simplyfied single dice throw (alternative)

As with the normal dice you can optional add an 'operand' and a 'value'.
| Example | Command (actual) |
| --- | ---|
/2-5      | rolls 2d20-5
/10/2     | rolls 1d10/2
/d13-2    | rolls 1d13-2

  
### Other dice:

| Command | Description |
| --- | ---|
/coin     | delivers exactly 'high (head)' or 'low (tail)'
/hit      | rolls where a character gets hit

  
### Other useful commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | ---|
/credits  | information about the contributors
/cut text | creates a seperator with 'text' as heading
/exit0    | shuts the bot down - you have to manually start it again afterwards
/status   | pings the bot to see if it is ready to be used
/version  | displays the current version of the bot
/wiki     | sends a link to Wookieepedia

  
### Bonus:
There are currently five commands that are intentional not listed here.   
Those five commands are eastereggs and do currently also need a '/' to get triggered.

  
## <#>-------------<=======[ Configurations ]=======>-------------<#>

Currently there are three easy configurations, you can change if you want.  
For doing this you do not have to know anything about programming.  
As this is an open source project you are free to edit the code yourself.

1. ### Hit body dice configuration:
    You are able to change the values of the bodyparts of the hit dice:

    ```
    247     arm = 3         # (consider: it's the value per arm)
    248     leg = 3         # (consider: it's the value per leg)
    249     head = 2
    250     back = 2
    251     chest = 4
    ```
    In this case the chance to hit the left arm is 3 out of 20  
    (arm +arm +leg +leg +head +back +chest = 20)  
    The sum (here 20) does not have to be exactly 20!

      
2. ### Token configration:
    
    ```
    351     token = "mytoken" # here you are able to replace the word <mytoken> with your 59 character token (not recommended)
    ```
    If you want to store your bot-token in the code you have to replace the word 'mytoken' but it is recommended not to store the token in the code. Read more about the token in chapter 'Token safety'.

      
3. ### Language output configuration:
    You can change the output texts of the bot in the xml-files of the languages-folder.  
    Please be aware that some symbols in xml have to be changed out with the correct representation (like: &, ', <, >).  
  
## <#>-------------<=======[ Token safety ]=======>-------------<#>
The token of a discord bot is unique and should not be readable to others.  

To clarify:  
Someone who is able to get the token of your discord bot will not be able to access your sourcecode or be able to gain access to your server or computer.
Someone who is able to get the token of your discord bot will be able to controll your bot from writing text messages up to deleting content, channels and even banning people from the server. This is due to the fact that any owner of the token can write own code - most times with malicious intentions - to be executed by your bot.  

The token is most likely like a TV-remote. Anyone who saw your TV-remote (=token) can build their own one (=code) and change the behaviour of your TV (=controll it).  

**If your token ever gets leaked, head immediately to the 'Discord Developer Portal' to change the token.**  

This is the reason the token should not be visible in the code, so you are not in danger of accedently revealing it to someone or even uploade it.
The first time you use LaBoum, it will automaticly ask you for the token. It will be saved in the 'token.txt'.  
In case you want to code with this bot and use git the token.txt is also listed in the .gitignore.
