token2             To protect your token from beeing detected in the sourcecode of LaBoum it will get stored in a seperate file named token.txt in the same folder.
token3             You can find the token in the bot-configuration of the discord developers portal.
token4             This is a one-time process, so next time you start the bot it will be able to get the token automaticly from the token.txt.
